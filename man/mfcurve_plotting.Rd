\title{Plot MF Curve Visualization Using Plotly}
\usage{
mfcurve_plotting(preprocessed, outcome, showTitle = TRUE, plotOrigin = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{preprocessed}{A list returned by \code{mfcurve_preprocessing} containing preprocessed data.}

\item{outcome}{A character string specifying the name of the outcome variable.}

\item{showTitle}{A logical value indicating whether to display a title on the plot (default is TRUE).}

\item{plotOrigin}{A logical value; if TRUE, the x- and y-axes are set to start at zero where applicable (default is FALSE).}
}
\value{
A Plotly object representing the combined plot. The plot is also printed to the active device.
}
\description{
This function creates a dynamic visualization using Plotly based on the preprocessed data
obtained from \code{mfcurve_preprocessing}. The upper panel displays the group means with error bars
(confidence intervals) and the overall grand mean, while the lower panel displays the factor levels.
Users can opt to include a dynamic title and adjust axis limits by setting the appropriate parameters.

  # Assuming 'preprocessed' is generated by mfcurve_preprocessing:
  preprocessed <- mfcurve_preprocessing(df, outcome = "wage", factors = c("race", "south", "union"))
  mfcurve_plotting(preprocessed, outcome = "wage", showTitle = TRUE, plotOrigin = TRUE)
}
