\title{Statistical Testing for mfcurve Analysis}
\usage{
mfcurve_stat_test(data, test = "mean", level = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the summarized results of the preprocessing step, with columns for group means, standard deviations, and counts.}

\item{test}{The type of test to perform: "mean" (compares each group's mean against the grand mean) or "zero" (compares each group's mean against zero).}

\item{level}{Significance level for confidence intervals and hypothesis testing (e.g., 0.05 for 95\% confidence).}
}
\value{
A data frame with the original data and added columns for t-values, p-values, significance flags, and confidence intervals.
}
\description{
This function performs statistical testing on grouped data, comparing each group's mean
against either the overall grand mean or zero, calculates confidence intervals, and flags significant results.

\examples{
# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  group = 1:4,
  mean_outcome = c(10, 20, 15, 25),
  sd_outcome = c(5, 6, 7, 8),
  n = c(10, 12, 15, 8)
)

# Test each group against the grand mean
test_result <- mfcurve_stat_test(data, test = "mean", level = 0.05)
print(test_result)

# Test each group against zero
test_result_zero <- mfcurve_stat_test(data, test = "zero", level = 0.05)
print(test_result_zero)
}
