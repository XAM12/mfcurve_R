\title{Perform Statistical Testing for Multi-Factor Curve Analysis}
\usage{
mfcurve_stat_testing(data, test = "mean", alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the summarized group-level data, typically output from \code{mfcurve_preprocessing}.}

\item{test}{A character string specifying the type of test to perform:
\itemize{
\item "mean": Compares each group's mean against the grand mean.
\item "zero": Compares each group's mean against zero.
}}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value indicating the significance level for confidence intervals and hypothesis testing (e.g., 0.05 for 95\% confidence). Default is 0.05.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns added to the input data:
\itemize{
\item \code{t_value}: The calculated t-value for each group.
\item \code{p_value}: The two-tailed p-value for the test.
\item \code{significant}: A logical flag indicating whether the result is statistically significant (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}).
\item \code{ci_lower}: The lower bound of the confidence interval for the group mean.
\item \code{ci_upper}: The upper bound of the confidence interval for the group mean.
}
}
\description{
This function conducts statistical testing on grouped data to:
\itemize{
\item Compare each group's mean against the overall grand mean or zero.
\item Calculate confidence intervals for group means.
\item Identify statistically significant differences using hypothesis tests.
}
}
\examples{
# Example data
data <- data.frame(
  group = c("A", "B", "C"),
  mean_outcome = c(15, 18, 22),
  sd_outcome = c(5, 6, 4),
  n = c(20, 25, 30)
)

# Test each group against the grand mean
test_result <- mfcurve_stat_testing(data, test = "mean", alpha = 0.05)
print(test_result)

# Test each group against zero
test_result_zero <- mfcurve_stat_testing(data, test = "zero", alpha = 0.05)
print(test_result_zero)
