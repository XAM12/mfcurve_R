\title{Preprocess Data for Multi-Factor Curve Analysis}
\usage{
mfcurve_preprocessing(data, outcome_var, factors, groupvar = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the dataset to be preprocessed.}

\item{outcome_var}{A character string specifying the name of the outcome variable (e.g., "wage").}

\item{factors}{A character vector specifying the factor variables used to define groups (e.g., \code{c("factor1", "factor2")}).}

\item{groupvar}{Optional. A character string specifying a predefined group variable. If \code{NULL}, the group variable is created by combining the specified factors.}
}
\value{
A data frame summarizing the following for each group:
\itemize{
\item \code{group}: The group identifier, combining levels of the factor variables.
\item \code{mean_outcome}: The mean value of the outcome variable for the group.
\item \code{sd_outcome}: The standard deviation of the outcome variable for the group.
\item \code{n}: The number of observations in the group.
\item \code{rank}: The rank of the group based on the mean outcome (ascending order).
\item Factor columns: The individual factor-level combinations derived from the "group" variable.
}
}
\description{
This function prepares the dataset for multi-factor curve analysis by:
\itemize{
\item Filtering out rows with missing values in the specified outcome and factor variables.
\item Creating a "group" variable based on the combinations of factor levels (if not already defined).
\item Calculating group-level summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, and count).
\item Ranking groups based on the mean outcome.
\item Splitting the "group" variable back into its constituent factor-level combinations for easier interpretation.
}

data <- data.frame(
  wage = c(10, 15, 20, 12, 18, 22),
  factor1 = c("A", "A", "B", "A", "B", "B"),
  factor2 = c("X", "Y", "X", "X", "Y", "X"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
